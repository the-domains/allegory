# Kurt Cobain

Im so lonely, that's ok I shaved my head and I'm not sad, and just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard but I'm not sure.

I'm so exited I can't wait to meet you there, but I don't care I'm so horny, ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b624daa9e1a941477c1a8d602f2a7a24badcbe2e.jpg)
