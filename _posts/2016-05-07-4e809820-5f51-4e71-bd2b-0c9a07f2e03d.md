# Kurt Cobain

_I'm so lonely, that's ok I shaved my head and I'm not sad, and just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard but I'm not sure. I'm so exited I can't wait to meet you there, but I don't care I'm so horny but that's ok my will is good___

I'm so happy 'cause today

I've found my friends ...

They're in my head

I'm so ugly, but that's okay, 'cause so are you ...

We broke our mirrors

Sunday morning is everyday for all I care ...

And I'm not scared

Light my candles, in a daze

'Cause I've found god

Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm so lonely, but that's okay, I shaved my head ...

And I'm not sad

And just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard ...

But I'm not sure

I'm so excited, I can't wait to meet you there ...

But I don't care

I'm so horny, but that's okay ...

My will is good

Yeah, yeah, yeah

I like it - I'm not gonna crack

I miss you - I'm not gonna crack

I love you - I'm not gonna crack

I killed you - I'm not gonna crack

I'm so happy 'cause today

I've found my friends ...

They're in my head

I'm so ugly, but that's okay, 'cause so are you ...

We broke our mirrors

Sunday morning is everyday for all I care ...

And I'm not scared

Light my candles in a daze ...

'Cause I've found god

Yeah, yeah, yeah

I like it - I'm not gonna crack

I miss you - I'm not gonna crack

I love you - I'm not gonna crack

I killed you - I'm not gonna crack
