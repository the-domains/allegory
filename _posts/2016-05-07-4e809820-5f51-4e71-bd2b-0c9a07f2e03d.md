## Kurt Cobain

Im so lonely, that's ok I shaved my head and I'm not sad, and just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard but I'm not sure.

I'm so exited I can't wait to meet you there, but I don't care I'm so horny, ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f20c1e2117926513f8985e6f3d9a53bd34b539b9.jpg)
