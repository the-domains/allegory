_I thought you died alone, a long long time ago. Oh no not me, I never lost control. Your face, to face with the man who sold the world_

_Listen_

We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when

Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend

Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes

I thought you died alone, a long long time ago

Oh no, not me

I never lost control

You're face to face

With The Man Who Sold The World

I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home

I searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed

I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here

We must have died alone, a long long time ago

Who knows? not me

We never lost control

You're face to face

With the man who 

Sold the World
