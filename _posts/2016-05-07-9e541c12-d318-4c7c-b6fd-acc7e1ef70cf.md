I never wanted to be your weekend lover, I only wanted to be some kind of friend. Baby I could never steal you from another

I never meant to cause you any sorrow

I never meant to cause you any pain

I only wanted one time to see you laughing

I only want to see you laughing in the purple rain

Purple rain Purple rain

Purple rain Purple rain

Purple rain Purple rain

I only want to see you bathing in the purple rain

I never wanted to be your weekend lover

I only wanted to be some kind of friend

Baby I could never steal you from another

It's such a shame our friendship had to end

Purple rain Purple rain

Purple rain Purple rain

Purple rain Purple rain

I only want to see you underneath the purple rain

Honey I know, I know, I know times are changing

It's time we all reach out for something new

That means you too

You say you want a leader

But you can't seem to make up your mind

I think you better close it

And let me guide you to the purple rain

Purple rain Purple rain

Purple rain Purple rain

If you know what I'm singing about up here

C'mon raise your hand

Purple rain Purple rain

I only want to see you

only want to see you

In the purple rain
