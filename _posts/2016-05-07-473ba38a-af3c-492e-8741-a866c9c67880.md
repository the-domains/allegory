I'm gonna make a change

For once in my life

It's gonna feel real good  
Gonna make a difference  
Gonna make it right

As I, turn up the collar on  
My favorite winter coat  
This wind is blowing my mind  
I see the kids in the streets  
With not enough to eat  
Who am I to be blind?  
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer disregard, a broken bottle top  
And a one man soul  
They follow each other on the wind ya' know  
'Cause they got nowhere to go  
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror  
I'm asking him to change his ways  
And no message could have been any clearer  
If you want to make the world a better place  
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love  
It's time that I realize  
That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan  
Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart  
And a washed-out dream  
They follow the pattern of the wind ya' see  
'Cause they got no place to be  
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror  
I'm asking him to change his ways  
And no message could have been any clearer  
If you want to make the world a better place  
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror  
I'm asking him to change his ways  
And no message could have been any clearer  
If you want to make the world a better place  
Take a look at yourself and then make that  
Change!

I'm starting with the man in the mirror  
(Oh yeah!)  
I'm asking him to change his ways  
(Better change!)  
No message could have been any clearer  
If you want to make the world a better place  
Take a look at yourself and then make the change)  
You gotta get it right, while you got the time  
You can't close your, your mind!

(Then you close your, mind!)  
That man, that man, that man, that man  
With the man in the mirror  
(Man in the mirror, oh yeah!)  
That man, that man, that man  
I'm asking him to change his ways  
(Better change!)  
No message could have been any clearer  
If you want to make the world a better place  
Take a look at yourself and then make the change

Oh no, no no

I'm gonna make a change

It's gonna feel real good!

Chime on!

(Change)

Just lift yourself

You know

You've got to stop it

Yourself!

(Yeah! Make that change!)

I've got to make that change, today!

Hoo!

(Man in the mirror)

You got to

You got to not let yourself

Brother

Hoo!

(Yeah! Make that change!)

You know, I've got to get

That man, that man

(Man in the mirror)

You've got to move! Chime on!

Chime on!

You got to

Stand up! Stand up! Stand up!

(Yeah! Make that change)

Stand up and lift yourself, now!

(Man in the mirror)

You know it!

You know it!

You know it!

You know it

(Change)

Make that change
